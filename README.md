# Lonpos 505 Puzzle-Solver
This is a java-based algorithm to calculate all unique solutions in the puzzle- and mindgame "lonpos". To check if all solutions are unique it also generates HTML files so you can check all solutions visually.

I've already run this code in my IDE, which gave me exactly 371,020 solutions. This also includes rotated and mirrored versions of each block. Each HTML file containts 1,000 solutions for a better overview. You can view all solutions in the "solutions.zip" file. Before beeing able to view the HTML files you have to unzip it so css can get loaded properly.

Depending on your computer ressources, the calculation of all solutions will take about 8 hours. If you dont want to run it, and just compare all solutions, you can download all solutions here on github.
