# lonpos-puzzle-solver
This is a algorithm to calculate all unique solutions in the puzzle- and mindgame "lonpos"

This also includes rotated and mirrored versions of each block.

Every thousand new solutions get generated in a html file for a better overview.
Unfortunately, the last <1000 solutions wont get sended into a html file, but all possible solutions still get printed into the console after finishing the algorithm, so you can still check if every solution is unique.
