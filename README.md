# lonpos-puzzle-solver
This is a algorithm to calculate all unique solutions in the puzzle- and mindgame "lonpos"

This also includes rotated and mirrored versions of each block.

Every thousand new solutions get generated in a html file for a better overview.
Unfortunately, the last <1000 solutions wont get sended into a html file, but all possible solutions still get printed into the console after finishing the algorithm, so you can still check if every solution is unique.

Depending on your computer ressources, the calculation of all solutions will take about 1-10 days.
If you dont want to run it, and just compare all solutions, you can download all solutions on zippyshare:
